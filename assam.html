        <div class="about">
            <p>Assam is a state in northeastern India, bordered by Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh to the north, Nagaland and Manipur to the east, Mizoram and Tripura to the south, and Bangladesh, Meghalaya, and West Bengal to the west. The name Assam is derived from the Ahom word "asama," meaning "peerless." Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, and Meghalaya were once part of Assam. The capital was shifted from Shillong (now Meghalaya's capital) to Dispur, a suburb of Guwahati, in 1972. Assam covers an area of 78,438 square km and had a population of 31,169,272 in 2011.</p>
            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief</h4>
            <p>Assam, shaped roughly like a Y laid on its side, is a land of plains and river valleys. It has three principal physical regions: the Brahmaputra River valley in the north, the Barak River valley in the south, and the hilly region between Meghalaya and Nagaland/Manipur in the south-central part. The Brahmaputra River valley is the largest. According to Hindu mythology, the Brahmaputra rises from a sacred pool known as Brahmakund in Arunachal Pradesh. The river enters Assam near Sadiya, flows westward for nearly 450 miles (725 km), and then turns south to enter Bangladesh. The valley, rarely more than 50 miles (80 km) wide, is surrounded by mountains except on the west and is dotted with isolated hills and ridges.<br/><br/>

                The Barak River valley, though only partly in Assam, forms an important agricultural lowland. Geologically, both valleys lie on ancient alluvial sediments covering Neogene and Paleogene deposits, including sandstone, sand, coal seams, shales, clays, and limestone.<br/><br/>
                
                The south-central hills, including the North Cachar Hills, are part of the Meghalaya Plateau, possibly an extension of ancient Gondwana. This rugged upland has elevations ranging from 1,500 feet (450 meters) to 3,300 feet (1,000 meters).<br/><br/>
                
                Between the Brahmaputra valley and the south-central hills are the northern ranges, extending from Dabaka to Bokakhat. The Rengma Hills, with an average elevation of about 3,000 feet (900 meters), have Chenghehishon as their prominent peak (4,460 feet [1,360 meters]).<br/><br/>
                
                Assam is prone to earthquakes. Significant ones occurred in 1897 (Shillong Plateau), 1930 (Dhuburi), and 1950 (Zayu, Tibet). The 1950 earthquake was particularly disastrous, causing landslides and floods that led to extensive loss of life and property.<br /><br />
            </p>
            
            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>In Assam, average temperatures range from highs of about 36°C (upper 90s F) in August to lows of about 7°C (mid-40s F) in January. The cool season lasts from October to February, characterized by fogs and brief showers. Assam generally escapes the hot, dry season typical of India. While some rain occurs from March through May, the heaviest rainfall comes with the southwest monsoon from June to September, often causing widespread flooding. Assam's annual rainfall is among the highest in the world, varying from about 70 inches (1,800 mm) in the west to over 120 inches (3,000 mm) in the east.</p><br />

            <h4>Plant and animal life</h4>
            <p>In the early 21st century, about one-third of Assam was covered with various woodlands, including tropical evergreen, deciduous, broad-leaved hill, pine, and swamp forests, as well as grasslands. Assam is home to around 75 tree species with commercial value, including sal (Shorea robusta) and hollong (Dipterocarpus retusus). Bamboo, orchids, and ferns are abundant.<br/><br/>

                Assam has numerous wildlife sanctuaries, including two UNESCO World Heritage sites: Kaziranga National Park (designated in 1985) on the Brahmaputra River and Manas Wildlife Sanctuary (designated in 1992) near the Bhutan border. Both are refuges for the endangered Indian one-horned rhinoceros, and Manas is also known for its tigers and leopards. Assam’s forests host elephants, gaurs, wild pigs, various deer species, langurs, and hoolock gibbons. Common birds include cormorants, herons, ducks, warblers, thrushes, owls, and peacocks. Endangered hornbills are characteristic of the state. Assam also has many reptiles, including kraits, cobras, vipers, lizards, skinks, geckos, and turtles.</p><br/>

            <h2>People of Assam</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>The people of the Brahmaputra and Barak valleys in Assam are mainly of Indo-Iranian ancestry, intermixed with Asiatic peoples. The Ahom people, arriving from Southeast Asia in the 13th century, originated from Yunnan, China. A significant minority comprises rural Indigenous peoples, officially designated as Scheduled Tribes, with the Bodo being the largest group. Most Scheduled Tribes, of Asiatic descent, live in the south-central hill region.<br/><br/>

                Assamese, an Indo-Aryan language, is the official and principal language, with literary records dating from the 14th century. Scheduled Tribes primarily speak Tibeto-Burman languages, though some have adopted Assamese. In the Barak valley, Bengali (Bangla) is commonly spoken.<br/><br/>
                
                About three-fifths of Assamese are Hindus, predominantly Vaishnavites. Roughly one-third practice Islam, mostly descendants of Bangladeshi settlers or Hindu converts. Many Scheduled Tribes have converted to Christianity, while some, like the Mikir and Kachari peoples, practice Hinduism or traditional local religions.<br/><br/></p>
            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <h4>Agriculture, forestry, and fishing</h4>
            <p>Agriculture is crucial to Assam, involving about half of the workforce and generating around one-third of the state's gross product. Rice dominates, covering more than two-thirds of the sown area. Tea and jute, primarily grown in the Brahmaputra valley, are key foreign-exchange earners. Assam produces a large portion of India’s tea, known for its strong, rich amber color. The Tocklai Tea Research Institute in Jorhat, founded in 1911, is the world’s oldest and largest tea research institute. Other crops include oilseeds, pulses, corn, sugarcane, rape, mustard, potatoes, and fruits. Improved farming methods have enabled some farms to yield multiple crops annually.<br/><br/>

                Livestock and dairy farming have grown moderately, largely due to government promotion, but they remain minor economic contributors. Sericulture is well-established, with Assam being a major silk producer. Muga silk, made by Indian Muga silkworms found only in the Brahmaputra valley, is the most prized and received a geographical indications tag in 2007. Assam is also known for mulberry silk (paat) and endi silk (eri), a warm, sustainable variety.<br/><br/>
                
                In forestry, sal and other tropical hardwoods are highly valued. However, forest depletion and erosion have led to logging bans and reforestation efforts. Key forest products include bamboo, firewood, and lac (for shellac).<br/><br/>
                
                Aquaculture has been a significant focus since the mid-1990s, with increased yields, though overall production still falls short of domestic demand.<br/></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Resources and power</h4>
            <p>Assam commercially exploits minerals such as petroleum, coal, natural gas, and limestone. Extensive oil reserves were discovered in northeastern Assam in the late 19th century. The Digboi refinery, built in 1901, was the first in South Asia. Refineries were later established in Noonmati (1962), Bongaigaon, and Numaligarh (1999). Coal is found in northeastern and south-central Assam and is used locally by railways, tea estates, and steamships. Liquefied natural gas is produced in the northeast, and limestone is quarried in the Mikir Hills (Karbi Anglong).<br/><br/>

                Assam’s energy comes from thermal and hydroelectric plants, but less than half is generated locally. The state purchases a significant portion of its power from the national government, private sources, and other state governments.<br/><br/></p>

            <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
            <p>Development of the manufacturing sector has been inhibited by the state’s isolation from the rest of India, by an underdeveloped transport system, by a small local market, and by the lack of sufficient capital. Small-scale industrial enterprises produce (or process) fertilizer, jute, paper, silk and textiles, sugar, chemicals, electronics, and cement. Sawmills and plywood and match factories make use of timber resources.</p><br/>

            <h4>Transportation </h4>
            <p>Historically, geography has inhibited the growth of efficient transport systems, and underdeveloped transport and communication systems have in turn hindered economic development in Assam. The Brahmaputra, for example, long has been a major barrier to integrating the transportation networks lying north and south of the river. The situation improved, however, with the opening of several rail and road bridges since the late 20th century. The Saraighat Bridge (1962) was the first bridge across the Brahmaputra in Assam. The Kalia Bhomora Bridge (1987), the Naranarayan Setu (1998), and other bridges have been constructed on the Brahmaputra since then.</p>
