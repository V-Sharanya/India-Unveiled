            <p>Gujarat, located on India's western coast along the Arabian Sea, includes the Kathiawar Peninsula (Saurashtra) and surrounding mainland. Bounded by Pakistan to the northwest, and the Indian states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra, Gujarat also borders the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and surrounds Daman and Diu. The state has a 992-mile (1,596 km) coastline, with no part more than 100 miles (160 km) from the sea. The capital is Gandhinagar, near Ahmadabad (Ahmedabad), the largest city and an important textile center where Mahatma Gandhi built his Sabarmati ashram.<br/><br/>

                Named after the Gurjara (a subtribe of the Huns) who ruled in the 8th and 9th centuries CE, Gujarat took its current form in 1960 when Bombay state was divided into Maharashtra and Gujarat based on language. The state covers an area of 75,685 square miles (196,024 square km) and had a population of 60,383,628 in 2011.</p>

            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief, drainage, and soils</h4>
            <p>Gujarat is a land of contrasts, from the seasonal salt deserts of the Kachchh (Kutch) district in the northwest, across the arid and semiarid scrublands of the Kathiawar Peninsula, to the wet, fertile coastal plains in the southeast. The Rann of Kachchh, including the Great Rann and Little Rann, are vast salt marshes covering about 9,000 square miles (23,300 square km). During the rainy season, the Rann floods, turning Kachchh into an island, while in the dry season, it becomes a sandy, salty plain plagued by dust storms.<br/><br/>

                The Kathiawar Peninsula, located between the Gulf of Kachchh and the Gulf of Khambhat, is generally arid and rises to a central hill area, with its highest elevation at 3,665 feet (1,117 meters) in the Girnar Hills. The soils are mostly poor, derived from old crystalline rocks, and rivers are mostly absent.<br/><br/>
                
                East of the Kathiawar Peninsula, small plains and low hills in the north merge with fertile farmlands in the south, enriched by basalts from the Deccan plateau. Southeastern Gujarat is crossed by the Narmada and Tapti (Tapi) rivers, both emptying into the Gulf of Khambhat. The terrain becomes mountainous towards the eastern border with Maharashtra, forming the northern extension of the Western Ghats.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>Winter (November through February) temperatures in Gujarat usually reach a high in the mid-80s F (about 28 °C), while lows drop into the mid-50s F (about 12 °C). Summers (March through May) are quite hot, however, with temperatures typically rising well above 100 °F (38 °C) during the day and dropping only into the 90s F (low 30s C) at night.<br/><br/>

                Gujarat is drier in the north than in the south. Rainfall is lowest in the northwestern part of the state—in the Rann of Kachchh—where it may amount to less than 15 inches (380 mm) annually. In the central portion of the Kathiawar Peninsula as well as in the northeastern region, annual rainfall typically amounts to about 40 inches (1,000 mm). Southeastern Gujarat, where the southwest monsoon brings heavy rains between June and September, is the wettest area; annual rainfall usually approaches 80 inches (2,000 mm) along the coastal plain.</p><br />

            <h4>Plant and animal life</h4>
            <p>Forests cover only a small portion of Gujarat, reflecting human activity as well as meagre rainfall. Scrub forest occurs in the northwestern region and across the Kathiawar Peninsula, the main species being babul acacias, capers, Indian jujubes, and toothbrush bushes (Salvadora persica). In some parts of the peninsula and northeastern Gujarat, deciduous species such as teak, catechu (cutch), axlewood, and Bengal kino (butea gum) are found. Deciduous forests are concentrated in the wetter southern and eastern hills. They produce valuable timbers, such as Vengai padauk (genus Pterocarpus; resembling mahogany), Malabar simal, and haldu (Adina cordifolia). The west coast of the peninsula is known for its algae, and the east coast produces papyrus, or paper plant (Cyperus papyrus).<br/><br/>

                Gir National Park, in the southwestern region of the Kathiawar Peninsula, contains rare Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica), and endangered Indian wild asses (Equus hemionus khur) are protected in a sanctuary near the Little Rann of Kachchh. The Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary, near Ahmadabad, attracts many species of birds migrating from the Siberian plains and elsewhere in winter. Saras cranes, Brahmini ducks, bustards, pelicans, cormorants, ibises, storks, herons, and egrets are among the most-notable species. The Rann of Kachchh is India’s only nesting ground of the greater flamingo. There is excellent offshore and inland fishing in Gujarat. Catches include pomfret, salmon, hilsa (a type of shad), jewfish (scianid fish), prawn, Bombay duck (a food fish), and tuna.</p><br/>

            <h2>People of Gujarat</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>The diverse peoples constituting the Gujarati population may be categorized broadly as either Indic (northern-derived) or Dravidian (southern-derived). The former include the Nagar Brahman, Bhatia, Bhadela, Rabari, and Mina castes. The Parsis, originally from Persia (Iran), represent a much later northern influx. Among the peoples of southern origin are the Bhangi, Koli, Dubla, Naikda, and Macchi-Kharwa. The rest of the population, including the aboriginal Bhil community, is of mixed heritage. Members of the Scheduled Castes (formerly “untouchables”) and Scheduled Tribes (indigenous minority peoples)—both official designations for those who are outside of India’s caste hierarchy—together form roughly one-fifth of the state’s population. Portions of the mountainous region of southeastern Gujarat are populated almost entirely by tribal peoples.<br/><br/></p>

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <h4>Agriculture</h4>
            <p>Unfavourable climatic conditions, salinity of soil and water, and rocky terrain have hampered Gujarat’s agricultural activities, but the sector has remained a major component of the state’s economy, employing about half the workforce. Wheat, millet, rice, and sorghum are the primary food crops, with rice production being concentrated in the wetter areas. Principal cash crops include cotton, oilseeds (especially peanuts [groundnuts]), tobacco, and sugarcane. Commercial dairying is also important.<br/></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Resources and power</h4>
            <p>Gujarat is rich in minerals, including limestone, manganese, gypsum, calcite, and bauxite. The state also has deposits of lignite, quartz sand, agate, and feldspar. The fine building stones of Porbandar, on the Kathiawar Peninsula, are among Gujarat’s most valuable products, and the state’s output of soda ash and salt amounts to a significant portion of the national yield. In addition, Gujarat produces petroleum and natural gas.

                The state draws its electricity from a variety of sources. The bulk of Gujarat’s power is supplied by coal- and gas-fueled thermal plants, followed by hydroelectric generators. There also are a number of wind farms scattered across the state.<br/><br/></p>

            <h4>Manufacturing and labour</h4>
            <p>Gujarat occupies a leading place in India’s manufacturing sector, especially in the production of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polyester textiles. The state’s major industrial belt exists in its southern sector. There is a large oil refinery at Koyali (near Vadodara), which supports a nearby petrochemical industry. Pharmaceutical production is concentrated at Vadodara, Ahmadabad, and Valsad. Small-scale, largely agriculture-based manufacturing is located in the Kathiawar Peninsula. Vegetable oil, cotton textiles, and cement are among the products of those industries.<br/><br/>

                Favourable investments, the availability of resources and power, solid management, and labour efficiency have been the basis of the state’s industrial development. Moreover, the Gandhian approach to labour problems—strict reliance on the truth, nonviolence, settlement by arbitration, minimal demands, and the use of the strike only as a last resort—has had a great impact in the field of industrial relations in Gujarat, which has remained relatively free from labour unrest.</p><br/>

            <h4>Transportation </h4>
            <p>Gujarat’s towns and cities are well connected—to each other and to the rest of India—by road and rail. Coastal shipping routes link the state’s many ports. Kandla is a major international shipping terminal. There is air service both within the state and to major Indian cities outside Gujarat.</p>
