        <div style="height: 260vh" class="about">
            <p>Rajasthan, state of northwestern India, located in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. It
                is bounded to the north and northeast by the states of Punjab and Haryana, to the east and southeast by
                the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, to the southwest by the state of Gujarat, and to the
                west and northwest by the provinces of Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan. The capital city is Jaipur, in the
                east-central part of the state.<br /><br />

                Rajasthan, meaning “The Abode of the Rajas,” was formerly called Rajputana, “The Country of the Rajputs”
                (sons of rajas [princes]). Before 1947, when India achieved independence from British rule, it comprised
                some two dozen princely states and chiefships, the small British-administered province of Ajmer-Merwara,
                and a few pockets of territory outside the main boundaries. After 1947 the princely states and
                chiefships were integrated into India in stages, and the state took the name Rajasthan. It assumed its
                present form on November 1, 1956, when the States Reorganization Act came into force. Area 132,139
                square miles (342,239 square km). Pop. (2011) 68,621,012.
            </p>

            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief and drainage </h4>
            <p>The Aravalli (Aravali) Range forms a line across the state running roughly from Guru Peak on Mount Abu
                (5,650 feet [1,722 metres]), near the town of Abu in the southwest, to the town of Khetri in the
                northeast. About three-fifths of the state lies northwest of that line, leaving the remaining two-fifths
                in the southeast. Those are the two natural divisions of Rajasthan. The northwestern tract is generally
                arid and unproductive, although its character shifts gradually from desert in the far west and northwest
                to comparatively fertile and habitable land toward the east. The region includes the Thar (Great Indian)
                Desert.<br /><br />

                The southeastern area lies at a somewhat higher elevation (330 to 1,150 feet [100 to 350 metres]) than
                its northwestern counterpart; it also is more fertile and has a more-diverse topography. The hilly tract
                of Mewar lies in the southern region, while a broad plateau stretches across the southeast. In the
                northeast a rugged badlands region follows the line of the Chambal River. Farther north, the landscape
                levels out into flat plains that are part of the alluvial basin of the Yamuna River.<br /><br />

                The Aravallis form Rajasthan’s most-important watershed. To the east of the range, the Chambal River—the
                only large and perennial stream in the state—and other waterways generally drain toward the northeast.
                The principal tributary of the Chambal, the Banas River, rises in the Aravallis near the great
                Kumbhalgarh hill fort and collects all the drainage of the Mewar plateau. Farther north, the Banganga,
                after rising near Jaipur, flows east toward the Yamuna before disappearing. The Luni is the only
                significant river west of the Aravallis. It rises near the city of Ajmer in central Rajasthan and flows
                some 200 miles (320 km) west-southwest into the Rann of Kachchh in Gujarat state. Northeast of the Luni
                basin is an area of internal drainage characterized by salt lakes, the largest of which is Sambhar Salt
                Lake. Farther to the west lies the true Marusthali (“Land of the Dead”), the barren wastelands and areas
                of sand dunes that form the heart of the Thar Desert.<br /><br />

            </p>

            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>Rajasthan has a wide range of climate that varies from extremely arid to humid. The humid zone spans the
                southeast and east. Except in the hills, the heat during the summer is intense everywhere, with
                temperatures in June—the warmest month—typically rising from the mid-80s F (about 30 °C) to nearly 110
                °F (low 40s C) daily. Hot winds and dust storms occur in the summer, especially in the desert tract. In
                January—the coolest of the winter months—daily maximum temperatures range from the upper 60s to the
                mid-70s F (low to mid-20s C), while minimum temperatures are generally in the mid-40s F (about 7 °C).
                The western desert has little rain, averaging about 4 inches (100 mm) annually. In the southeast,
                however, some areas may receive almost 20 inches (500 mm). Southeastern Rajasthan benefits from both the
                Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal branches of the southwest (summer) monsoon winds, which bring the bulk of
                the annual rainfall.</p><br /><br />

            <h4>Plant and Animal Life</h4>
            <p>The predominant vegetation of Rajasthan is scrub jungle. Toward the west there are typical arid-zone
                plants, such as tamarisk (genus Tamarix) and false tamarisk (genus Myricaria). Trees are scarce, limited
                mostly to small, scattered forest areas in the Aravallis and in the eastern part of the state. Less than
                10 percent of Rajasthan is under forest cover.<br /><br />

                A number of notable large mammals are regular residents of Rajasthan. Tigers are found primarily in the
                Aravallis. Leopards, sloth bears, Indian sambar (dark brown Indian deer), and chital (spotted deer)
                occur in the hills and forests. Nilgais (bluebucks; large antelope) are also found in parts, and
                blackbucks are numerous in the plains. Common birds include snipes, quail, partridges, and wild ducks;
                they occur everywhere except in the desert. The northwestern part of the state is well known for several
                species of sandgrouse.<br /><br />

                Numerous sanctuaries and wildlife parks have been established in the state. Among the most important of
                those are Sariska National Park (established 1955), near Alwar in the northeast; Desert National Park
                (1980), near Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan; and Keoladeo Ghana National Park (1981), in the eastern
                part of the state near Bharatpur—the latter designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985.</p>

            <h2>People of Rajasthan</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>Most of Rajasthan’s population consists of Indians of various social, occupational, and religious
                backgrounds. The Rajputs (various clans of landowning rulers and their descendants), though representing
                only a small percentage of Rajasthan’s residents, are perhaps the most-notable section of the
                population; indeed, the state draws its name from that community. In terms of caste structure, the
                Brahmans (highest caste) are subdivided into many gotras (lineages), while the Mahajans (trading caste)
                are subdivided into a bewildering number of groups. In the north and west the Jats (peasant caste) and
                Gujars (herding caste) are among the largest agricultural communities.<br /><br />

                Aboriginal (tribal) peoples constitute more than one-tenth of the population of Rajasthan. In the
                eastern part of the state, those groups include the Mina (and the related Meo), most of whom are
                farmers; the Banjara, who have been known as traveling traders and artisans; and the Gadia Lohar,
                another historically itinerant tribe, who traditionally have made and repaired agricultural and
                household implements. The Bhil, one of the oldest communities in India, generally inhabit southern
                Rajasthan and have a history of possessing great skill in archery. The Grasia and Kathodi also largely
                live in the south, mostly in the Mewar region. Sahariya communities are found in the southeast, and the
                Rabari, who traditionally are cattle breeders, live to the west of the Aravallis in west-central
                Rajasthan.<br /><br />

                Hindi is the official language of the state, and to some degree it has overshadowed the local languages
                of Rajasthan. Much of the state’s population, however, continues to speak Rajasthani languages, which
                comprise a group of Indo-Aryan languages and dialects derived from Dingal, a tongue in which bards once
                sang of the glories of their masters. The four main Rajasthani language groups are Marwari in western
                Rajasthan, Jaipuri or Dhundhari in the east and southeast, Malvi in the southeast, and in the northeast
                Mewati, which shades off into Braj Bhasa (a Hindi dialect) toward the border with Uttar
                Pradesh.<br /><br />

                Hinduism, the religion of the vast majority of the population, is generally practiced through the
                worship of Brahma, Shiva, Shakti, Vishnu, and other deities. The town of Nathdwara, in southern
                Rajasthan, is an important religious centre for the Vallabhacharya school of Krishna worshippers. There
                are also followers of Arya Samaj, a type of reformed Hinduism that stems from the late 19th
                century.<br /><br />

                Islam, the state’s second largest religious community, expanded in Rajasthan with the conquest of the
                city of Ajmer and the surrounding area by Muslim invaders in the late 12th century. Khwājah Muʿīn al-Dīn
                Chishtī, the Muslim missionary and mystic, had his headquarters at Ajmer, and Muslim traders, craftsmen,
                and soldiers settled there.<br /><br />

                Jainism is also important; it has not been the religion of the rulers of Rajasthan but has followers
                among the trading class and the wealthy section of society. The towns and temples of Mahavirji,
                Ranakpur, Dhulev, and Karera are the chief centres of Jain pilgrimage. Another important religious
                community is formed by the Dadupanthis, the followers of the 16th-century saint Dadu, who preached the
                equality of all people, strict vegetarianism, total abstinence from intoxicating beverages, and lifelong
                celibacy. The state also has small populations of Christians and Sikhs.<br /><br /></p>

            <h4>Settlement patterns</h4>
            <p>Rajasthan is one of the least densely populated states in India, with roughly three-fourths of its
                residents living in rural settlements. Traditional rural houses are huts with mud walls and roofs
                thatched with straw. They have a single door but no windows or ventilators. The houses of more-affluent
                farmers and artisans in larger villages have more than one room. They are roofed with tiles and have a
                veranda and large courtyard, whose main door will admit a loaded bull cart. The earthen floors are
                coated with mud and dung.<br /><br />

                The state’s urban population has grown faster than the rural population since the late 20th century.
                Jaipur is by far the largest city of Rajasthan. Other major urban centres include Jodhpur, Kota,
                Bikaner, Ajmer, and Udaipur. With the exception of Jodhpur and Bikaner, all lie to the east of the
                Aravalli Range.</p>
