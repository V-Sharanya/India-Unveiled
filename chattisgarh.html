        <div class="about">
            <p>Chhattisgarh, state of east-central India. It is bounded by the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand to the north and northeast, Odisha (Orissa) to the east, Telangana (formerly part of Andhra Pradesh) to the south, and Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh to the west. Its capital is Raipur. Area 52,199 square miles (135,194 square km). Pop. (2011) 25,540,196.</p>

            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief, drainage, and soils</h4>
            <p>Chhattisgarh is located in the Chhattisgarh Plain, forming the upper Mahanadi River basin at an elevation of 800 to 950 feet (250 to 300 meters) above sea level. This structural plain features topographic variations from extensive denudation, including knolls, undulating interfluves, and valleys with clayey soils. The plain, about 100 miles (160 km) wide, is bounded by the Chota Nagpur plateau to the north, the Maikala Range to the west, the hills of Raigarh to the northeast, the Raipur upland to the southeast, and the Bastar plateau to the south, with highlands reaching over 2,300 feet (700 meters) in the Maikala Range and Dandakaranya hills.<br/><br/>

            Earthquakes are relatively infrequent in Chhattisgarh, though mild seismic activity has been recorded in northern Chhattisgarh, along the Telangana border, and around Raigarh.<br /><br />

            Chhattisgarh is home to the Mahanadi River, originating near Raipur. It flows westward for about 200 km, meets the Shivnath River near Bilaspur, then flows east into Odisha, emptying into the Bay of Bengal. Other rivers in Chhattisgarh include the Indravati, Arpa, and Pairi.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>Chhattisgarh's climate follows a monsoon pattern with three distinct seasons: summer (March to May), monsoon (June to September), and winter (November to February). Summers are hot and dry, with temperatures often exceeding 85 °F (30 °C) and sometimes surpassing 100 °F (upper 30s C). Winters are pleasant and dry, with temperatures in the upper 70s F (mid-20s C). Most rainfall occurs during the southwest monsoon, ranging from 47 to 60 inches (1,200 to 1,500 mm) annually, with significant rainfall in the northern region during December and January.</p><br />

            <h4>Plant and animal life</h4>
            <p>The eastern and southeastern borderlands of Chhattisgarh are characterized by moist deciduous plant life, but toward the interior of the state, this flora is replaced by dry deciduous vegetation, often degenerating locally into scrub. The most valuable hardwoods are teak and sal (Shorea robusta). A type of tree called salai yields a resin used for incense and medicine, while leaves from tendu trees are used for rolling bidi (Indian cigarettes). Bamboo is abundant and is harvested for many purposes.<br/><br/>

                The forests are home to a broad array of animals, including tigers, striped hyenas, and blackbucks. Other species include the chital (spotted deer), gaur (a type of wild buffalo), sambar deer, sloth bear, wild boar, and four-horned antelope, among others. The woodlands are also inhabited by many species of birds. Chhattisgarh has several national parks and many wildlife sanctuaries. The Indravati National Park contains a wildlife sanctuary for tigers.</p><br/>

            <h2>People of Chattisgarh</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>Chhattisgarh is home to a diverse population, including many from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, with the Gond people being the most prominent among the latter. While Hinduism is the predominant religion, there are significant communities of Muslims, Jains, Christians, Buddhists, and a small group of Sikhs. Chhattisgarhi and Hindi are the official languages, with Gondi spoken by many Gond people. Other languages spoken include Marathi, Urdu, Oriya, Gujarati, and Punjabi.<br/><br/></p>

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p>The economy of Chhattisgarh is founded primarily on mining, agriculture, energy production, and manufacturing. The state has major deposits of coal, iron ore, dolomite, and other minerals. The central lowland is known especially for its abundant rice production, and the state as a whole provides the bulk of the country’s tendu leaves for bidis. Chhattisgarh also is a significant regional supplier of electricity, from both thermal and hydroelectric generators. The state’s manufacturing activities focus largely on metals production.</p><br/>
            <h4>Agriculture, forestry, and fishing</h4>
            <p>About half of Chhattisgarh’s land is farmland, with the rest largely forested or unsuitable for cultivation. Three-fourths of the farmland is cultivated, earning the region the nickname "country’s rice bowl" due to its central plain supplying grain to numerous rice mills. Maize and millet are prevalent in the highlands, while cotton and oilseeds are key commercial crops. Agriculture is largely manual, with slow adoption of mechanization in the basin. Livestock farming, including cows, buffalo, goats, sheep, and pigs, is also significant. Centres in Bilaspur and Dhar focus on improving livestock quality through artificial insemination and crossbreeding.<br/></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Resources and power</h4>
            <p>Chhattisgarh, rich in minerals, has major reserves of coal, iron ore, limestone, bauxite, and dolomite, along with significant deposits of tin, manganese ore, gold, and copper. It is a leading supplier of dolomite and has top-quality iron ore primarily in its south-central and southern regions. Diamonds have been found near Raipur.<br/><br/>

                The state produces more power than it consumes, primarily from thermal power plants near Korba, and also has significant hydroelectric potential. Key hydroelectric projects include the Ban Sagar dam (with Bihar and Uttar Pradesh) and the Harked dam on the Mahanadi River. The Hasdeo Bango hydroelectric project is also near Korba.<br/><br/></p>

            <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
            <p>Chhattisgarh has been industrializing—slowly but certainly—since the late 20th century. As part of this planned development, the government has established a number of industrial estates, notably at Raipur and Bhilai Nagar.<br/><br/>

                There now are dozens of large- and medium-scale steel industries producing hot metal, pig iron, sponge iron, rails, ingots, and plates; Bhilai Nagar is the site of an especially large iron-and-steel plant. Many of the metal industries, as well as other emergent enterprises such as the production of microelectronics and high-tech optical fibres, receive government support.<br/><br/>
                
                In the private sector there are cement works, as well as assorted mills producing paper, sugar, textiles (cotton, wool, silk, and jute), lumber, flour, and oil (from oilseeds). A number of factories manufacture fertilizer, synthetic fibres, and chemicals. Most small-scale industries of Chhattisgarh are centred on the production of traditional handiworks, including textiles (such as saris), carpets, pottery, and gold- and silver-thread embroidery.</p><br/>

            <h4>Transportation </h4>
            <p>Chhattisgarh is well connected to the rest of the country by road, rail, and air. The state is traversed by several national and state highways, as well as by some of the major rail routes. Most of Chhattisgarh’s larger cities are the sites of important railway junctions. Airports at Raipur and Bilaspur serve commercial flights, and the development of airports at Raigarh, Jagdalpur, and Ambikapur began in the 2010s.</p>
            <h2>Government and Society</h2>
            <p>The structure of Chhattisgarh’s government, like that of most other Indian states, is defined by the national constitution of 1950. The head of state—the governor—is appointed by the president of India. The governor is aided and advised by a chief minister, who heads the Council of Ministers, which is responsible to the elected Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha). Although the political capital of Chhattisgarh is Raipur, the High Court is located in Bilaspur. A chief justice presides over the High Court.<br/><br/>

                Local government includes several divisions, which are subdivided further into districts. Each division is administered by a commissioner, while each is headed by a collector. Collectors exercise both executive and magisterial power.<br/><br/>
                
                A large area of Chhattisgarh is under the control of the Naxalites (Maoist guerrillas). Indeed, in several pockets of Bastar division in the south, state law has at times failed to function. The conflict ultimately has hampered the development of this fertile area.</p>
