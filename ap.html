        <div class="about">
            <p>Andhra Pradesh, located in southeastern India, is bordered by Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana,
                Odisha, and the Bay of Bengal. Telangana was part of Andhra Pradesh until it became a separate state
                in 2014, with Hyderabad initially serving as the joint capital. In 2024, Amaravati was designated as
                the new capital of Andhra Pradesh.

                Named after the Andhra people who have inhabited the area since antiquity and speak Telugu, Andhra
                Pradesh was formed in 1956. The state is primarily agricultural but also engages in mining and
                industry. It covers an area of 106,204 square miles (275,068 square km) and had a population of
                84,665,533 in 2011.</p>
            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief, drainage, and soils</h4>
            <p><b>Andhra Pradesh has three main physiographic regions:</b><br/>

                <b>1. Coastal Plain:</b> Also known as the Andhra region, it runs almost the entire length of the state
                along the Bay of Bengal. This fertile area is watered by rivers such as the Godavari and Krishna,
                forming deltas with alluvial soil.<br/>

                <b>2. Eastern Ghats:</b> This mountain range runs parallel to the east coast and is part of a larger
                system extending from central to southern India. It is characterized by porous soils and is interrupted
                by major river valleys.<br/>

                <b>3. Plateau:</b> Located in the southwest, this region, known as Rayalaseema, is part of the Deccan
                Plateau. Composed of gneissic rock, it features elevations over 2,000 feet (600 meters) and slopes
                northeast. The Penneru River is the main drainage system, and the area has red sandy soil, isolated
                hills, and some black soil regions.<br/><br/></p>
            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p><b>Andhra Pradesh experiences three distinct seasons:</b><br/>

                <b>1. Summer (March to June):</b> Summers are extremely hot and humid, with temperatures often exceeding
                95 °F (35 °C) and reaching over 104 °F (40 °C) in central areas. Nighttime temperatures drop below 70 °F
                (20 °C) only in the far southwest.<br/>

                <b>2. Monsoon (July to September):</b> This season brings tropical rains, primarily from the southwest
                monsoon.<br/>

                <b>3. Winter (October to February):</b> Winters are cooler, with January temperatures ranging between 86
                and 95 °F (30 and 35 °C) in most areas, and dropping below 60 °F (15 °C) only in the extreme northeast.<br/><br/>

                <b>Annual Precipitation:</b><br/>
                - Coastal areas: 40 to 47 inches (1,000 to 1,200 mm) per year.<br/>
                - Southwestern plateau: About half of the coastal area's rainfall.<br/>
                - Northeastern mountains: 47 to 55 inches (1,400 mm) annually.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <h4>Plant and animal life</h4>
            <p>The coastal plain of Andhra Pradesh is fringed with mangrove swamps and palm trees, while thorny
                vegetation covers the hills of the plateau. About one-fifth of the state is forested, primarily in the
                Eastern Ghats, featuring moist deciduous and dry savanna vegetation, with teak, rosewood, wild fruit
                trees, and bamboo. Common trees elsewhere include neem, banyan, mango, and pipal. The state also boasts
                a variety of flowering plants, including jasmine, rose, and endemic species, especially in the Eastern
                Ghats.<br/><br/>

                <b>Wildlife:</b><br/>
                - <b>Mammals:</b> Tigers, blackbucks, hyenas, sloth bears, gaurs, and chital.<br/>
                - <b>Birds:</b> Flamingos, pelicans, and rare species like Jerdon’s courser.<br/>
                - <b>Other:</b> Sea turtles nest along the eastern coast.</p><br/><br/>
            <h2>People of Andhra Pradesh</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>The population of Andhra Pradesh is highly diverse, identified primarily by language, religion, and
                social class or caste rather than specific ethnic affiliation.<br/>

                - <b>Languages:</b> Telugu is the official and most widely spoken language. Other languages include Urdu,
                Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Marathi, and Oriya, along with Lambadi (Banjari) and languages spoken by the
                state's Scheduled Tribes.<br/>
                - <b>Scheduled Tribes and Castes:</b> These groups, including the Scheduled Castes (formerly called
                "untouchables"), make up more than one-fifth of the population.<br/>
                - <b>Religion:</b> The majority of residents practice Hinduism. There are smaller communities of Muslims,
                primarily in the Rayalaseema region, and Christians, mainly in urban centers and coastal areas.<br/></p>
            <h4>Settlement patterns</h4>
            <p>Nearly one-third of Andhra Pradesh's population resides in urban areas. About half of these urban
                dwellers live in the state's 10 most populous cities, particularly in the industrial and manufacturing
                hubs around Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada in the northeast. Other significant cities include Guntur,
                Kurnool, and Rajahmundry.<br/></p>
            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <h4>Agriculture, forestry, and fishing</h4>
            <p>Agriculture, primarily food grain production, remains a significant but declining part of Andhra Pradesh's economy. The state is a top producer of rice and tobacco in India, with its major rivers, especially the Godavari, Krishna, and Penneru, supporting its agricultural prominence. Historically, irrigation benefits were limited to coastal districts, but mid-20th-century efforts led to dam and reservoir construction that expanded irrigation to both coastal and upland regions. Projects like the Nagarjuna Sagar have boosted rice and sugarcane production, leading to local agro-industrial development. Other important crops include cereal grains, pulses, peanuts, corn, cotton, fruits, and vegetables. Animal husbandry, particularly dairy and egg production, has grown significantly. The state's woodlands provide valuable timber and non-timber products, and its fishing industry, supported by aquaculture and open-sea fisheries, is also expanding, with prawns and shrimp as key products.</p><br/>
            <h4>Resources and power</h4>
            <p>Andhra Pradesh's principal mineral resources include asbestos, mica, manganese, barite, and high-grade coal, with low-grade iron ore in the south. The state is a major producer of barite and the only one in southern India with significant coal reserves. Large natural gas deposits have been discovered in the Godavari and Krishna basins. Historically, the Golconda diamond mines were famous for the Koh-i-noor diamond. The state also has quartz, limestone, and graphite, and a mining corporation oversees resource exploitation.<br/><br/>

            Most of the state's energy comes from public-sector thermal generators, with hydroelectric power from stations on the Krishna River at Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar as a secondary source. Additionally, the government has established wind farms, and private companies are developing natural gas, wind, biomass, and other nonconventional power sources.</p><br/>
            <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
            <p>Since the mid-20th century, Andhra Pradesh has become one of India's most industrialized states. Industry—including mining, utilities, construction, and manufacturing—contributes significantly to the state’s income, comparable to agriculture, though manufacturing alone accounts for a smaller proportion. Key industries in Visakhapatnam include shipbuilding, aeronautics, and the manufacture of electrical equipment, machine tools, and drugs. Private enterprises in the Vijayawada and Guntur areas produce chemicals, textiles, cement, fertilizers, processed foods, petroleum derivatives, and cigarettes. Moderate-sized enterprises, such as sugar factories, are distributed across smaller urban areas. Visakhapatnam hosts a large steel plant, oil refinery, and shipbuilding yard. Increased power from hydroelectric and thermoelectric projects has supported industrialization and irrigation.</p><br/>
            <h4>Services</h4>
            <p>The service sector is the largest component of Andhra Pradesh’s economy, contributing more than half of its value. Major components include banking and insurance, communications, and public administration, with other services, such as tourism, making up the rest. Tourism has become increasingly important, attracting visitors to the state's Hindu and Buddhist cultural landmarks, natural areas in the mountains, and vibrant cities.</p><br/>
            <h4>Transportation</h4>
            <p>Andhra Pradesh has several airports, notably in Vijayawada, Tirupati, and Visakhapatnam. An extensive road and rail network connects the state with most parts of India. Bus transportation, largely privately operated, provides express travel between cities. Coastal river canals, particularly the Kommamur (Buckingham) Canal, are used for cargo transportation, running parallel to the coast from the Krishna River south to Chennai in Tamil Nadu. Visakhapatnam is a major international seaport.</p>
