            <p>Jharkhand, state of India, located in the northeastern part of the country. Jharkhand is bordered by the states of Bihar to the north, West Bengal to the east, Odisha to the south, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Uttar Pradesh to the northwest. Its capital is Ranchi.<br/><br/>

                Jharkhand, one of India’s newest states, was carved out of the southern portion of Bihar in 2000. Statehood was the culmination of a long struggle carried on primarily by the Adivasis, or Scheduled Tribes (an official term applied primarily to indigenous communities that fall outside the predominant Indian caste hierarchy). Indian independence brought relatively little socioeconomic benefit to the people of the Jharkhand area, which led to widespread discontent with the Bihar administration, particularly among the tribal peoples. The tribal groups initiated a call for independence from Bihar, and in the 1980s they became militant in their demand. In the 1990s, the separation movement spread to nontribal communities, ultimately precipitating the creation of a new state. Area 28,833 square miles (74,677 square km). Pop. (2011) 32,966,238.</p>

            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief and drainage</h4>
            <p>The most prominent physical feature of Jharkhand is the Chota Nagpur plateau, part of the vast Deccan plateau that occupies most of peninsular India. Chota Nagpur, actually a series of plateaus, hills, and valleys, covers nearly the entire state and consists primarily of crystalline rocks. The main plateaus, Hazaribag and Ranchi, are separated by the faulted sedimentary coal-bearing basin of the Damodar River, and they average about 2,000 feet (610 metres) in elevation. In the west there are more than 300 dissected but flat-topped plateaus (called pats), many with elevations of more than 3,000 feet (900 metres). The highest point in Jharkhand is formed by the conical granite peak of Parasnath, which rises to 4,477 feet (1,365 metres) on the Hazaribag plateau; it is sacred in the Jain religion and to the Santhal people. Lowland plains flank the plateaus in the northwestern and northeastern parts of the state.<br/><br/>

                In addition to the Damodar River in the northeast, the state is drained by the Subarnarekha River in the southeast and by the Brahmani River in the south. A third major river, the Son, runs along much of the northwestern state boundary. The soil in the Damodar valley is sandy, but heavier red soils are typical of the plateau regions.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            
            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>There are three well-defined seasons in Jharkhand. The cold-weather season, from November to February, is the most pleasant part of the year. High temperatures in Ranchi in December usually rise from about 50 °F (10 °C) into the low 70s F (low 20s C) daily. The hot-weather season lasts from March to mid-June. May, the hottest month, is characterized by daily high temperatures in the upper 90s F (about 37 °C) and low temperatures in the mid-70s F (mid-20s C). The season of the southwest monsoon, from mid-June to October, brings nearly all of the state’s annual rainfall, which ranges from about 40 inches (1,000 mm) in the west-central part of the state to more than 60 inches (1,500 mm) in the southwest. Rainfall on the plateau is generally heavier than on the plains. Nearly half of the annual precipitation falls in July and August.</p><br />

            <h2>People of Jharkhand</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>Nearly two-fifths of the population of Jharkhand consists of various indigenous peoples classified as Scheduled Tribes, as well as members of the Scheduled Castes (formerly called “untouchables”; groups that officially occupy a low position within the Indian caste hierarchy). The Santhal, Oraon (Kurukh), Munda, Kharia, and Ho are the principal indigenous groups, and together they constitute the great majority of the total tribal population. Non-Scheduled peoples, who hold a higher status within the traditional Indian social system, constitute most of the remaining three-fifths of the population.<br/><br/>

                Hindus constitute the religious majority in Jharkhand. The Hindu population comprises the elite upper castes (Brahmans, Bhumihars, Rajputs, and Kayasthas), the large and diverse community of less-advantaged castes (such as the Yadavas, Kurmis, and Banias), and the Scheduled Castes (notably, the Chamars or Mochis, Dusadhs, and Mushars). Most of the tribal groups also follow Hinduism, although Christianity is significant among the Munda, Kharia, and Oraon peoples. Some members of the Scheduled Tribes—especially from the Ho community—adhere to local religions. There also is a notable Muslim minority within the state.<br/><br/>
                
                Languages from the Indo-European family are the most widely spoken in Jharkhand. Most prominent of these are Hindi; the Bihari languages of Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magadhi; and Urdu, which is used primarily within the Muslim community. Some of the tribal languages—including Munda, Santhal, and Ho—belong to the Austroasiatic family, while other indigenous communities, such as the Oraon, speak Dravidian languages.<br/><br/></p>

            <h4>Settlement patterns</h4>
            <p>With just over one-tenth of its population classified as urban, Jharkhand remained one of the most rural states in India in the early 21st century. Dispersed villages are characteristic of Chota Nagpur, where settlement is confined largely to river valleys, deforested peneplains (areas reduced almost to plains by erosion), and mineral and industrial belts. The indigenous groups are concentrated mostly in the districts of Ranchi in central Jharkhand, Dumka in the northeast, and East and West Singhbhum in the southeast. The major cities and urban agglomerations are Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad-Jharia-Sindri, and Bokaro-Chas.<br/><br/></p>

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <h4>Agriculture</h4>
            <p>Jharkhand is endowed with surface water and groundwater, fertile land, and a moderate climate, all of which have helped the state build a strong agriculture sector. The state’s agricultural-development programs have especially emphasized the raising of livestock for meat, dairy products, and wool. In an effort to improve quality and to increase the output of mutton and wool, a selective sheep-breeding program was implemented in the town of Chatra, in the northwest, and wool-collection centres were established in the district of East Singhbhum. Most of the state’s goats are raised in the districts of Dumka, Deoghar, and Godda, all in the northeast, although the state also has goat farms in Sahibganj, Chatra, and Ranchi districts. There are pig farms in various towns across the state, notably in Kanke (in Ranchi district), Saraikela (near Dhanbad), and Jamshedpur.<br/></p>
            <br />

            <h4>Resources and Power</h4>
            <p>The Chota Nagpur plateau is the richest mineral belt in India, and it is responsible for a significant share (by value) of the country’s mineral yield. Jharkhand produces almost the entire national output of copper, kyanite (used in the manufacture of heat-resistant porcelain), pyrite (used to make sulfuric acid), and phosphate, as well as much of the output of bauxite (a source of aluminium), mica, kaolin and other clays, and iron ore. Most of these minerals are mined in the districts of East and West Singhbhum. Coal, however, accounts for the bulk of Jharkhand’s mineral production. The principal coalfields, all in the Damodar River valley in eastern Jharkhand, supply most of the coking coal of India.<br/><br/>

                The Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) is the most prominent multipurpose power project of Jharkhand. The corporation operates several thermal plants and hydroelectric dams not only in Jharkhand but also in neighbouring West Bengal; all the stations are networked within the DVC grid, which serves urban and rural areas in both states.<br/><br/></p>
