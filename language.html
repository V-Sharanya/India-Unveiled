                    <p>Known as a "museum of languages," India is home to numerous languages and dialects, reflecting
                        its linguistic plurality. This plurality is marked by a seamless transition rather than stark
                        divisions, with dialects gradually blending into one another. In transitional zones,
                        multilingualism is common as individuals navigate the contact between different languages.</p>

                    <h1> History of Indian Languages</h1>
                    <p>The Indian language branch's history is frequently divided into three stages:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Old Sanskrit, which includes Vedic and classical Sanskrit.</li>
                        <li>Middle (approximately 3rd century BCE) consists of the Prakrit varieties of Sanskrit,
                            including Pali, and Late (about 3rd century BCE).</li>
                        <li>The contemporary languages of the northern and central parts of the Indian subcontinent are
                            included in this category, dating from around the 10th century CE.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Linguistic overview:</h2>
                    <img class="linguistic" src="linguistic.png" />
                    <p>Indian languages have originated from various sources and are strongly tied with India’s
                        different ethnic groupings. It is divided into six categories:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Indo-Aryan</li>
                        <li>Sino-Tibetan</li>
                        <li>Dravidian</li>
                        <li>Negroid</li>
                        <li>Austric</li>
                        <li>Others</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Over the years, Indian languages have interacted with one another, resulting in the primary
                        language divisions of modern India. Indo-Aryan and Dravidian are dominant, including all of
                        India’s major languages.<br /><br />

                        <b>Indo-Aryan:</b> India’s most populous linguistic group, accounting for roughly 74 percent of

                        other northern and western Indian languages.<br /><br />

                        <b>Dravidian:</b> It is the second significant group, consisting primarily of Southern Indian
                        languages. It includes Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam, the Dravidian group’s primary
                        languages.<br /><br />

                        <b>Sino-Tibetan: </b>The Sino-Tibetan is found throughout the Himalayan regions, including
                        Bihar, Bengal, and Assam, as well as the country’s north-eastern borders.<br /><br />

                        <b>Austric:</b> The Austro-Asiatic sub-family includes Munda languages spoken in the middle,
                        eastern, and north-eastern India, as well as Mon-Khmer languages such as Khasi and
                        Nicobarese.<br /><br />

                        <b>Others:</b> Adivasi languages, such as Gondi, Kurukh, Khond, Parji, and Mal-Pahariya are
                        included in this category. They are unique and cannot be categorized in other

                    <p>The Indian Constitution particularly specifies 22 languages for a reason: the number of speakers
                        determines which languages are spoken on India’s national and state levels. Almost everyone in
                        the country speaks one or more languages.<br /><br />

                        Hindi is India’s most spoken language and the world’s second most spoken language. It is native
                        to over 100 million people, the majority of whom live in North India. Despite coming from
                        various linguistic backgrounds, a large majority of the Indian population speaks Hindi.
                        <br /><br />
                        During India’s independence, Hindi was regarded as a common language. The Indian constitution
                        designated sixteen languages as official languages in 1950. Later, 14 additional languages were
                        added to the list, bringing the total number of official languages in India to 22. The
                        northwestern section of India is home to the majority of Hindi speakers. They account for half
                        of the country’s population, which spans 11 states, including Delhi and Uttar
                        Pradesh.<br /><br /><br />

                        <b>English - </b>
                        Although English remains a symbol of the British Raj for some, others appreciate its continued
                        usage as an official language in India, mainly because it is (unofficially) acknowledged as a
                        business language. Many tourists believe that the better your English is, the more money you
                        have in Indian merchants’ eyes.<br /><br /><br />

                        <b>However, especially among the top classes, English does not have a prominent presence in
                            India’s broad social life. For many Indians, English is no longer a foreign language because
                            Indians adopted it after over a century of colonization. Indian English is distinct from
                            Standard English for cultural and linguistic reasons and is commonly referred to as
                            “Hinglish.”</b>
