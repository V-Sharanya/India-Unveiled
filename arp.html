        <div class="about">
            <p>Arunachal Pradesh, a state in northeastern India, is bordered by Bhutan to the west, the Tibet Autonomous
                Region of China to the north, Myanmar (Burma) and Nagaland to the south and southeast, and Assam to the
                south and southwest. Its capital is Itanagar. Known as the "Land of the Rising Sun," it is mentioned in
                ancient Hindu literature such as the Kalika-purana, Mahabharata, and Ramayana. Formerly the North East
                Frontier Agency during British rule, it was part of Assam until becoming the Indian union territory of
                Arunachal Pradesh in 1972 and a state in 1987. The region remains disputed between India and China. It
                covers 32,333 square miles (83,743 square km) and had a population of 1,382,611 in 2011.</p>
            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief</h4>
            <p>Most of Arunachal Pradesh’s terrain consists of deep valleys flanked by highland plateaus and ridges that
                rise to the peaks of the Great Himalayas. The state encompasses three broad physiographic regions:<br />

                <b>1. Foothills in the South:</b> These foothills, similar to the Siwalik Range, rise from the Assam
                plains to elevations of 1,000 to 3,300 feet (300 to 1,000 metres).<br />
                <b>2. Lesser Himalayas:</b> Northward, the terrain ascends rapidly to the Lesser Himalayas, with ridges
                and spurs reaching up to 10,000 feet (3,000 metres).<br />
                <b>3. Great Himalayas:</b> Along the Tibetan border lie the main ranges of the Great Himalayas,
                dominated by Kangto, the highest peak in the state at about 23,260 feet (7,090 metres).<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h4>Drainage and soils</h4>
            <p>The major rivers of the state include the Brahmaputra and its tributaries: the Dibang, Lohit, Subansiri, Kameng, and Tirap. The Brahmaputra, known as the Tsangpo in Tibet and Dihang in Arunachal Pradesh, flows east from Mansarovar Lake in Tibet, south through the Himalayas, and then across Arunachal Pradesh before reaching the Assam plains near Pasighat. It is joined by the Dibang and Lohit rivers just south of the Assam-Arunachal border. The Subansiri crosses the Himalayan ranges, while the Kameng and other rivers rise on the southern flanks of the mountains. The Tirap River drains the southeastern part of the state.<br/><br/>

                In Chandigarh, the Rock Garden, created by self-taught artist Nek Chand Saini, is known for its unique environmental art.<br/><br/>
                
                Soils in the region vary significantly with terrain, but are generally acidic and prone to erosion in mountainous areas. Major soil types include inceptisols, entisols, and ultisols, with rich alluvial soils in river valleys ideal for agriculture.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>Arunachal Pradesh has a diverse climate that varies with elevation. The foothill zone experiences a subtropical climate with hot, humid summers, reaching mid-90s Fahrenheit (mid-30s Celsius) from June to August, and mild winters with temperatures in the mid-50s Fahrenheit (about 13°C) in December, January, and February. In higher elevations, temperatures decrease as altitude increases.<br/><br/>

                The state has a wet-dry monsoon pattern, receiving about 130 inches (3,300 mm) of rainfall annually, mostly between April and September. In central areas, rainfall can exceed 160 inches (4,100 mm) annually.</p><br />
            <h4>Plant and animal life</h4>
            <p>Arunachal Pradesh's diverse terrain, climate, and soils support rich fauna and flora. About two-thirds of the state is forested, with swampy rainforests in the foothills, tropical evergreen and subtropical pine forests at lower elevations, and mixed and coniferous temperate forests higher up. Subalpine and alpine vegetation, including prominent rhododendrons, is found at the highest elevations. The state also has numerous medicinal plants like ginseng and yew.<br/><br/>

                The animal life is equally diverse, including tigers, clouded leopards, snow leopards, elephants, wild buffalo, and various goats like serow and goral. Deer species, primates such as hoolock gibbons and macaques, bharals, black bears, red pandas, musk deer, and takins are found in different regions. The state also boasts a rich variety of fish, snakes, and hundreds of bird species, highlighting its biodiversity.</p><br/>
            <h2>People of Arunachal Pradesh</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>Arunachal Pradesh is ethnically diverse, with many tribal groups having cultural and historical links to Tibet and western Myanmar. Over two-thirds of the population are Scheduled Tribes, indigenous peoples outside the traditional Indian social hierarchy.<br/><br/>

                Western Arunachal Pradesh is home to the Nissi, Sherdukpen, Aka, Monpa, Apa Tani, and Hill Miri tribes. The central region is predominantly inhabited by the Adi, the state's largest tribal group. The northeastern hills are occupied by the Mishmi, while Tirap in the southeast is home to the Wancho, Nocte, and Tangsa tribes. These tribes live in rural areas, practicing subsistence farming along with hunting, fishing, and gathering. <br/><br/>
                
                In addition to Scheduled Tribes, the population includes immigrants from Bangladesh and neighboring states like Assam and Nagaland. The state has around 50 tribal languages, mostly Tibeto-Burman, with Assamese, Hindi, and English often serving as lingua franca. Tribal religions involve spirits and nature deities, with ritual sacrifices common. Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, and Theravada Buddhism are practiced in different regions.<br/><br/>
                
                Arunachal Pradesh has the lowest population density among Indian states, with most people living in low-lying valleys. The state has no cities and fewer than two dozen towns, with Itanagar being the largest town.<br/><br/></p>
            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <h4>Agriculture, forestry, and fishing</h4>
            <p>In Arunachal Pradesh, agriculture is a major livelihood, with over half the population engaged in farming, though only a small fraction of land is cultivated. Settled agriculture, including wet-rice farming, has expanded since the late 20th century, but many hill communities still practice traditional shifting agriculture (jhum). This method involves clearing land, cultivating it for a few years, and then abandoning it as soil fertility declines, growing crops like rice, corn, millet, and buckwheat. Major commercial crops include oilseeds, potatoes, ginger, sugarcane, and various vegetables.<br/><br/>

                Animal husbandry is also significant, with mithuns raised throughout the state, yaks in higher elevations, and sheep herded by the Monpa tribe. Some groups practice aquaculture for fish.<br/><br/>
                
                Historically, the economy benefited from logging and forestry, but production has sharply declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations, and the forestry sector has since diminished, supporting only a few local industries.<br/></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Resources and power</h4>
            <p>Arunachal Pradesh possesses significant, largely untapped resources, including rivers, coal, and petroleum, with most of its power supplied by hydroelectric plants. The state also has mineral resources such as dolomite, quartzite, limestone, and marble. In the early 21st century, efforts have been made to expand both hydroelectric and solar power generation.<br/><br/></p>
            <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
            <p>Arunachal Pradesh's manufacturing sector mainly comprises medium- and small-scale industries. Key handicrafts include basketry, weaving, and carpets. Smaller industries involve rice and vegetable-oil milling, fruit processing, forest-based products, and steel fabrication. Sericulture is significant, with the state producing various silk yarns. Economic development policies have encouraged industrial expansion, leading to the establishment of industrial estates in Itanagar, Naharlagun, Pasighat, and Deomali.</p><br/>
            <h4>Transportation and telecommunications</h4>
            <p>Arunachal Pradesh's rugged terrain makes transport and communications challenging, with few paved roads and historically no railways. The region relies on an active network of footpaths connecting villages at different elevations. Major transportation centers are in neighboring Assam, including the nearest airport at Lilabari and the railhead at Harmoti. Since 2014, a rail line connects Harmoti to Naharlagun. Regular bus services from Itanagar link to various towns in Assam and Shillong in Meghalaya.<br/><br/>

                Telecommunications were initially underdeveloped, with limited landline service. However, since 2000, mobile telephone coverage has expanded into remote areas, and internet access, including fibre-optic cables, has improved in the early 21st century.</p>
