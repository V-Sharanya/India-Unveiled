        <div class="about">
            <p>Bihar is a state in eastern India, bordered by Nepal to the north, West Bengal to the northeast, and Uttar Pradesh to the west. In November 2000, Jharkhand was created from Bihar's southern provinces, forming its southern and southeastern borders. The capital is Patna.<br/><br/>

                Historically, Bihar held a significant position as the principal seat of imperial powers and a focal point of Indian culture and civilization. The name Bihar derives from the Sanskrit "vihara" (Buddhist monastery), reflecting its ancient prominence. The state covers 38,301 square miles (99,200 square km) and had a population of 103,804,637 in 2011.</p>
            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief, drainage, and soils</h4>
            <p>Bihar is divided by the Ganges River into the North Bihar Plains and the South Bihar Plains, part of the middle Gangetic Plain. The North Bihar Plain, except for the Himalayan foothills in the northwest, is a flat alluvial region prone to flooding, lying less than 250 feet (75 meters) above sea level. Rivers such as the Ghaghara, Gandak, Baghmati, Kosi, and Mahananda flow from the Himalayas into the Ganges, often changing channels. The Kosi River, known as the "Sorrow of Bihar" for its floods, is now confined within artificial embankments. The northern plain's soil varies from sandy loam in the west to clay in the east. The region is also prone to seismic activity, with major earthquakes in 1934 and 1988 causing widespread damage.<br/><br/>

                The South Bihar Plain is more varied, with many hills rising from the alluvium. The southern rivers, except for the Son, are small and used for irrigation. The soil is mainly older alluvium, composed of dark clay or yellowish loam, with sandy soils in the south. The Kaimur Plateau lies in the southwest, beyond the Son River valley, with sandstone over a limestone base.<br /><br />
            </p>
            
            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>Bihar has three well-defined seasons: the hot-weather season (March to mid-June), the southwest monsoon season (mid-June to October), and the cold-weather season (November to February). May is the hottest month, with temperatures regularly exceeding 90°F (32°C), except in the extreme north. January is the coolest month, with temperatures typically rising to the low 70s°F (about 22°C). Annual rainfall varies from about 40 inches (1,000 mm) in west-central Bihar to over 60 inches (1,500 mm) in the extreme north. Nearly all the rain falls between June and October, with July and August being the wettest months. The cold-weather season is the most pleasant.</p><br />

            <h4>Plant and animal life</h4>
            <p>Bihar's natural vegetation is deciduous forest, though only a small area is forested, mainly in the Himalayan foothills. The plains have largely been cleared for cultivation. The foothills feature valuable sal trees (Shorea robusta), bamboo, reeds, and grasses. Common trees on the plain include banyans, Bo trees, and palmyra palms.<br/><br/>

                In the more inaccessible forest regions, large mammals like Bengal tigers, leopards, elephants, and various deer species are found. Crocodiles are numerous along the Kosi River. Significant populations of the endangered adjutant stork (Leptoptilos dubius) inhabit the Kosi and Ganges floodplains. Small mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish are common throughout the state.</p><br/>

            <h2>People of Bihar</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>In Bihar, people are primarily classified by religion, social caste and lineage, and language rather than specific ethnic affiliation. Hindus make up the majority, with Muslims being the largest minority, mostly residing in northern Bihar, especially around Purnia. The Hindu population includes elite upper castes (Brahmans, Bhumihars, Rajputs, Kayasthas), Backward Classes (Yadavas, Kurmis, Banias), and Scheduled Castes (Chamars or Mochis, Dusadhs, Mushars). There are also smaller groups of indigenous peoples, the Scheduled Tribes, mostly Hindus with a few Christians.<br/><br/>

                Most people speak Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Urdu (mainly spoken by Muslims), and Bihari languages like Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi. Bhojpuri is spoken in the western districts, Maithili in Darbhanga and Saharsa, and Magahi in Patna, Gaya, and Munger. Indigenous minorities such as the Munda, Santhal, and Ho speak Austroasiatic languages, while the Oraon speak a Dravidian language.<br/><br/></p>
            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p>Nearly three-fourths of Bihar's population is engaged in agriculture, making the state one of India's top producers of vegetables and fruits. Despite gains in mining and manufacturing in the late 20th century, Bihar has lagged behind other Indian states in per capita income, with a large segment of the population remaining below the poverty level. The creation of Jharkhand from Bihar’s southern region at the turn of the 21st century further strained Bihar’s struggling economy.</p><br/>
            <h4>Agriculture, forestry, and fishing</h4>
            <p>About half of Bihar is under cultivation, with limited scope for further agricultural expansion due to population pressure. The cropping pattern reflects the transitional climate, featuring a mix of wet and dry crops. Rice is the dominant crop, supplemented by wheat, corn (maize), barley, and pulses. Sugarcane is grown in the northwest, while jute is found in the easternmost plain districts.<br/><br/>

                There are three annual harvests: <br/>
                - <b>Bhadai:</b> Corn, sown from May to June and harvested in August and September.<br/>
                - <b>Aghani:</b> Primarily rice, sown in mid-June and harvested in December.<br/>
                - <b>Rabi:</b> Wheat, ripening in the plains from March to May.<br/><br/>
                
                Fruits and vegetables are widely cultivated. Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga are known for mangoes, bananas, and litchi fruits. Vegetables thrive near large towns, with Bihar Sharif in Patna district producing high-quality seed potatoes. Chilies and tobacco are significant cash crops along the banks of the Ganges.<br/></p>
            <br />
            <h4>Resources and power</h4>
            <p>Bihar's mineral wealth was significantly reduced when the mineral-rich Chota Nagpur plateau became part of Jharkhand. However, there are still a few areas where minerals are found. Bauxite is located in Munger, while the Rohtas district has dolomite, glass sand, cement mortar, and other minerals. Mica deposits are found in Gaya, Nawada, and Munger. Additionally, salt is produced in Gaya, Munger, and Muzaffarpur.<br/><br/>

                Bihar's energy is supplied by a small number of thermal and hydroelectric power stations, which are insufficient to meet the state's needs. Several power stations were lost with the creation of Jharkhand. In the early 21st century, less than half of the state's villages had regular electricity.<br/><br/></p>

            <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
            <p>Bihar has been slow to develop its industry, but the state government has set up various agencies to boost development. Most manufacturing workers are employed in household industries, with the rest in steel, metal-based, and food-processing industries.<br/><br/>

                Larger industries are concentrated in Dalmianagar (paper, cement, chemicals), Baruni (petrochemicals), and Patna (light manufacturing). Agricultural-based industries include sugar refining, tobacco processing, silk production, and jute milling. Traditional cottage industries are popular, including sericulture, lac and glasswork, handloom products, brassware, and pottery. Madhubani paintings, depicting mythological stories on cloth, have become a notable export.</p><br/>

            <h4>Transportation </h4>
            <p>Waterways in Bihar, once important, are now of little significance. While all-weather roads reach just over one-third of the state's villages, several national highways, including the historic Grand Trunk Road, pass through Bihar. Road service is best around Patna, where World War II Allied operations brought many improvements. <br/><br/>

                The rail line between Kolkata (Calcutta) and Delhi, which opened in 1864, crosses Bihar and carries heavy traffic due to the dense population. Railways generally run parallel to rivers to avoid bridge construction, making travel between key towns often lengthy. Regularly scheduled airlines serve Patna.</p>
