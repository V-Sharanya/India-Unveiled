            <p>Maharashtra, state of India, occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan plateau in the western
                peninsular part of the subcontinent. Its shape roughly resembles a triangle, with the 450-mile (725-km)
                western coastline forming the base and its interior narrowing to a blunt apex some 500 miles (800 km) to
                the east. Maharashtra is bounded by the Indian states of Gujarat to the northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the
                north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the southeast, Karnataka to the south, and Goa to the
                southwest and by the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and the Arabian Sea to the
                west.<br /><br />

                Maharashtra’s capital, Mumbai (formerly Bombay), is an island city on the western coast, connected to
                the mainland by roads and railways. Aptly called the gateway of India, Maharashtra is one of India’s
                biggest commercial and industrial centers, and it has played a significant role in the country’s social
                and political life.<br /><br />

                Maharashtra is a leader among Indian states in terms of agricultural and industrial production, trade
                and transport, and education. Its ancient culture, at one stage considerably obscured by British
                dominance, survives largely through the medium of a strong literary heritage. A common literature in
                Marathi, the predominant language of the state, has in fact played an important role in nurturing a
                sense of unity among the Maharashtrians. Area 118,800 square miles (307,690 square km). Pop. (2011)
                112,372,972.
            </p>

            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief, drainage and soil</h4>
            <p>Maharashtra presents a complex range of physical diversity. To the west is the narrow Konkan coastal
                lowland, which reaches its widest extent near Mumbai. Numerous minor hills dominate the relief. There
                are many small, swift, west-flowing streams, most of them less than 50 miles (80 km) long. The biggest,
                the Ulhas, rising in the Bhor Ghat, joins the sea after an 80-mile (130-km) course.<br /><br />

                The Western Ghats (a mountain range at the western edge of the Deccan plateau; ghat means “pass” in
                Marathi) run almost continuously for 400 miles (640 km) north-south, with the foothills reaching to
                within 4 miles (6.4 km) of the Arabian Sea. Elevations increase northward to peaks of some 4,720 feet
                (1,440 meters). There are a few passes through which roads and railroads link the coast with the
                interior. The eastern slopes of the Ghats descend gently to the Deccan plateau and are sculptured by the
                wide mature valleys of the Krishna, Bhima, and Godavari rivers.<br /><br />

                Between the Narmada River valley in the north, the Krishna basin in the south, and the western coast to
                as far east as the city of Nagpur, the Ghats and the triangular plateau inland are covered with
                extensive lava outpourings called traps. They reach a maximum thickness of some 10,000 feet (3,000
                meters) near Mumbai. The differential erosion of lava has resulted in characteristic steppelike slopes,
                uniform crest lines, and a tabletop appearance of many hills in Maharashtra.<br /><br />

                Around Nagpur, the Deccan Traps give way to undulating uplands (about 890 to 1,080 feet [270 to 330
                meters] high) underlain by ancient crystalline rocks. The Wardha-Wainganga valley, part of the larger
                Godavari basin, trends southward and has many lakes.<br /><br />

                A major part of Maharashtra is covered in black soils derived from decomposed lava rocks that are
                commonly called “black cotton soils” (because cotton often is grown in them). Drifts along the slopes
                have eroded into medium brown and light-colored sandy soils. Saline soils in the river valleys are the
                results of impeded soil drainage followed by intense evaporation.<br /><br />
            </p>

            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>The climate is subtropical to tropical (depending on elevation) and characteristically monsoonal (i.e., wet-dry), with local variations. India’s southwest monsoonal rains break on the Mumbai coast usually in the first week of June and last until September, during which period they account for about four-fifths of the annual rainfall. Four seasons are normal: March–May (hot and dry), June–September (hot and wet), October–November (warm and dry), and December–February (cool and dry).<br/><br/>

                The Western Ghats and the ranges on the northern borders greatly influence the climate and separate the wet Konkan Coast from the dry interior upland, an area called the Desh. Rainfall is extremely heavy in Konkan, averaging about 100 inches (2,540 mm), with some of the wettest spots receiving up to 250 inches (6,350 mm), but rapidly diminishes to one-fifth of that amount east of the Ghats. Rainfall increases again in the eastern areas, reaching about 40 to 80 inches (1,000 to 2,000 mm) in the extreme east.<br/><br/>
                
                The coastal regions enjoy equable temperatures; monthly averages at Mumbai are in the low 80s F (about 27–28 °C). A change of more than about 13 °F (7 °C) between day and night temperatures is unusual. Pune (Poona), higher up on the plateau, benefits from cooler temperatures throughout the year. In the interior, average summer temperatures reach into the low 100s F (about 38–41 °C), and winter temperatures average in the low 70s F (about 21–23 °C).</p><br /><br />

            <h4>Plant and Animal Life</h4>
            <p>Forests cover less than one-fifth of the state and are confined to the Western Ghats, mainly their transverse ranges, the Satpura Range in the north, and the Chandrapur region in the east. On the coast and adjoining slopes, plant forms are rich with lofty trees, variegated shrubs, and mango and coconut trees. The forests yield teak, bamboo, myrobalan (for dyeing), and other woods.<br/><br/>

                Thorny savanna-like vegetation occurs in areas of lesser rainfall, notably in upland Maharashtra. Subtropical vegetation is found on higher plateaus that receive heavy rain and have milder temperatures. Bamboo, chestnut, and magnolia are common. In the semiarid tracts, wild dates are found. Mangrove vegetation occurs in marshes and estuaries along the coast.<br/><br/>
                
                Wild animals include tigers, leopards, bison, and several species of antelope. The striped hyena, wild hog, and sloth bear are common. Monkeys and snakes occur in great variety, as do ducks and other game birds. The peacock is indigenous. Many of those animals can be viewed at the state’s national parks at Tadoba, Chikhaldara, and Borivli. The state’s abundant marine life in the waters off the western coast remains largely unexploited.</p>

            <h2>People of Maharashtra</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>Maharashtrians are ethnically heterogeneous. The Bhil, Warli, Gond, Korku, Govari, and dozens of other tribal communities—all officially designated as Scheduled Tribes—live on the slopes of the Western Ghats and the Satpura Range. Marathas and Kunbis (descendants of settlers who arrived from the north about the beginning of the 1st century ce) make up the majority of the remainder of the people of Maharashtra. The state also has a significant population of those who were once called “untouchables” but are now officially classed as Scheduled Castes, most of whom live in rural areas.<br/><br/>

                Marathi, the official state language, is spoken by more than four-fifths of the population. Other languages spoken in the state are Gujarati, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Sindhi, Urdu, Bengali, Malayalam, and English. There are also many local languages, including Konkani on the west coast and Gondi, Varhadi, and Mundari in the eastern and northern forests.<br /><br />

                Maharashtra’s religious diversity reflects that of India as a whole. Hindus predominate, followed by Muslims and Buddhists. There are many Christians in the metropolitan areas. Jewish and Parsi (a religious minority adhering to Zoroastrianism) groups have settled mostly in urban areas; Parsis live mainly in Mumbai and its environs. Other religious minorities include Jainas and Sikhs, whose small communities are widespread.<br /><br /></p>

            <h4>Settlement patterns</h4>
            <p>More than half of the population is rural and lives in villages. The urban-rural ratio has been changing, however, especially since the late 20th century, when some two-thirds were rural dwellers. Mumbai, the largest city in the state, is also the most populous metropolis in India. Nagpur, Pune, and Solapur are other major cities. Of particular historical interest is the Mughal city of Aurangabad, in the northwest-central part of the state, which contains several monuments and other historic buildings.<br /><br /></p>

            <h2>Economy</h2>
            <p>The national and state governments have promoted both improved agricultural techniques and increased industrialization of the economy. As a result, Maharashtra has become one of the most developed and prosperous Indian states. Mumbai, one of India’s most important ports, handles an enormous foreign trade. It is a hub of manufacturing, finance, and administration but also a national center for motion-picture production. Pune has developed many industries because of its proximity to Mumbai. Nagpur and Solapur have textile and other agriculturally based industries.</p>
