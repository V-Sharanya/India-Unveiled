            <p>Uttarakhand, state of India, located in the northwestern part of the country. It is bordered to the northwest by the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, to the northeast by the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, to the southeast by Nepal, and to the south and southwest by the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Its capital is the northwestern city of Dehra Dun.<br/><br/>

                On November 9, 2000, the state of Uttaranchal—the 27th state of India—was carved out of Uttar Pradesh, and in January 2007 the new state changed its name to Uttarakhand, meaning “northern region,” which was the traditional name for the area. Area 19,739 square miles (51,125 square km). Pop. (2011) 10,116,752.</p>

            <h2>Land</h2>
            <h4>Relief and drainage </h4>
            <p>Uttarakhand has a highly varied topography, with snow-covered peaks, glaciers, deep canyons, roaring streams, beautiful lakes, and a few patches of dusty plains in the south. Some of the highest mountains in the world are found in Uttarakhand. Most notably, these include Nanda Devi (25,646 feet [7,817 metres]), which is the second highest peak in India, Kamet (25,446 feet [7,756 metres]), and Badrinath (23,420 feet [7,138 metres]).<br/><br/>

                Uttarakhand can be divided into several physiographic zones, all running parallel to each other from northwest to southeast. The northern zone, popularly known as the Himadri, contains segments of the Zaskar and the Great Himalaya ranges, with elevations ranging roughly from 10,000 to 25,000 feet (3,000 to 7,600 metres). Most of the major peaks are located in this zone. Adjacent to and south of the Great Himalayas is a zone containing the Lesser Himalayas, known popularly as the Himachal, with elevations between about 6,500 and 10,000 feet (2,000 to 3,000 metres); the zone has two linear ranges—the Mussoorie and the Nag Tibba. To the south of the Himachal is a stretch of the Siwalik Range. The entire area containing the Himadri, the Himachal, and the Siwaliks is broadly known as the Kumaun Himalayas. The southern edge of the Siwalik Range merges with a narrow bed of gravel and alluvium known as the Bhabar, which interfaces to the southeast with the marshy terrain known as the Tarai. The combined Siwalik-Bhabar-Tarai area ranges in elevation from 1,000 to 10,000 feet (300 to 3,000 metres). South of the Siwaliks are found flat-floored depressions, known locally as duns, such as the Dehra Dun.<br/><br/>
            
                The state is drained by various rivers of the Ganges (Ganga) system. The westernmost watershed is formed by the Yamuna River and its major tributary, the Tons. The land to the east of this basin is drained by the Bhagirathi and the Alaknanda—which join to form the Ganges at the town of Devaprayag—and the Mandakini, Pindar, and Dhauliganga, all principal tributaries of the Alaknanda. To the east again are the southward-flowing Ramganga and Kosi rivers, and draining to the southeast in the same region are the Sarju and Goriganga, both of which join the Kali at Uttarakhand’s eastern border with Nepal.<br/><br/></p>

            <h4>Climate</h4>
            <p>The climate of Uttarakhand is temperate, marked by seasonal variations in temperature but also affected by tropical monsoons. January is the coldest month, with daily high temperatures averaging below freezing in the north and near 70 °F (21 °C) in the southeast. In the north, July is the hottest month, with temperatures typically rising from the mid-40s F (about 7 °C) to about 70 °F daily. In the southeast, May is the warmest month, with daily temperatures normally reaching the low 100s F (about 38 °C) from a low around 80 °F (27 °C). Most of the state’s roughly 60 inches (1,500 mm) of annual precipitation is brought by the southwest monsoon, which blows from July through September. Floods and landslides are problems during the rainy season in the lower stretches of the valleys. In the northern parts of the state, 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 metres) of snowfall is common between December and March.</p><br /><br />

            <h4>Plant and Animal Life</h4>
            <p>Four major forest types are found in the Uttarakhand, including alpine meadows in the extreme north, temperate forests in the Great Himalayas, tropical deciduous forests in the Lesser Himalayas, and thorn forests in the Siwalik Range and in parts of the Tarai. According to official statistics, more than 60 percent of Uttarakhand is under forest cover; in actuality, however, the coverage is much less. The forests provide not only timber and fuel wood but also extensive grazing land for livestock. Only a small portion of the state’s total land area has permanent pastures.<br/><br/>

                Common tree species of the temperate forests include Himalayan cedar (Deodar cedar), Himalayan (blue) pine, oak, silver fir, spruce, chestnut, elm, poplar, birch, yew, cypress, and rhododendron. Tropical deciduous forests of sal, teak, and shisham—all hardwoods—occur in the submontane tract. Thorn forests of dhak (a type of flowering tree), babul (a type of acacia), and various bushes occur in the south.<br/><br/>
                
                Uttarakhand has a rich array of animal life. Tigers, leopards, elephants, wild boars, and sloth bears are among the state’s large mammals. Common birds include pigeons, doves, ducks, partridges, peacocks, jays, quail, and woodpeckers. Crocodiles are found in some areas. Lions and rhinoceroses have become extinct in the region. A number of national parks and sanctuaries have been established to preserve Uttarakhand’s wildlife.</p>

            <h2>People of Uttarakhand</h2>
            <h4>Population composition</h4>
            <p>Uttarakhand has a multiethnic population spread across two recognized geocultural regions: the Gahrwal, which corresponds roughly to the northwestern half of the state, and the Kumaun, which spans the southeast. Rajputs (various clans of landowning rulers and their descendants)—including members of the indigenous Garhwali, Gujjar, and Kumauni communities, as well as a number of immigrant peoples—constitute a large portion of the population. Of the total population, nearly one-fifth belongs to the Scheduled Castes (an official designation for those groups that traditionally have occupied a low position within the Indian caste system); these people are collectively called Kols or Doms. Scheduled Tribes (an official category embracing indigenous peoples who fall outside the Indian social system), such as the Raji, who live near the border with Nepal, account for less than 5 percent of the population.<br/><br/>

                Most of the people of Uttarakhand speak Indo-Aryan languages. Hindi is the official language of the state. Hindustani, which contains words from both Hindi and Urdu, is the principal spoken language. Other languages used in Uttarakhand include Garhwali and Kumauni (both Pahari languages), Punjabi, and Nepali.<br/><br/>
                
                More than four-fifths of Uttarakhand’s residents are Hindu. Muslims constitute the largest religious minority, accounting for about one-tenth of the population. Smaller communities of Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, and Jains make up most of the remainder of Uttarakhand’s people.<br/><br/></p>

            <h4>Settlement patterns</h4>
            <p>The sparse population of Uttarakhand is unevenly distributed throughout the state. Most people live in rural settlements, which usually take the form of small linear villages set alongside paths or roads. Typical rural houses have two stories, with part of the lower level used for keeping animals. Most are built from local stone with mud used as mortar. Roofs are generally made of slate tiles or corrugated iron sheets. Although such homes may have few amenities compared with their urban counterparts, the ever-increasing network of paved roads, as well as the availability of electricity and consumer goods, such as radios and televisions, has drawn much of Uttarakhand’s rural population into the mainstream of state and national society.<br/><br/>

                About one-fourth of the total population lives in several dozen urban centres, located primarily in the southern part of the state. Northern and eastern Uttarakhand have experienced a comparatively slow rate of urbanization. With the exception of Dehra Dun and several other cities—including Haridwar, Haldwani, Roorkee, Kashipur, and Rudrapur—most of Uttarakhand’s urban centres are actually large towns, with populations of less than 50,000.</p>

            <h2>Economy</h2>

            <h4>Manufacturing </h4>
            <p>Manufacturing activities have continued to expand in Uttarakhand; within just a few years of attaining statehood, the contribution of the sector to the state’s gross product, at about 25 percent, had exceeded that of agriculture. The government assists agriculture-based and food-processing industries such as sugar milling, as well as the manufacture of wood and paper products, woolen garments, and leather goods. Among Uttarakhand’s other notable manufactures are cement, pharmaceuticals, automobiles and other transportation equipment, and electrical products.</p><br/>

            <h4>Transportation</h4>
            <p>Roads of various descriptions connect nearly all towns of Uttarakhand. Although the central and southern portions of the state are served by several national highways, the northern border zones are not connected by official roads at all; rather, an extensive network of mountain trails links the villages with nearby towns. Several railway tracks extend from the plains of Uttar Pradesh into the valleys of southern and eastern Uttarakhand. Major towns served by these railways include Dehra Dun, Haridwar, Rishikesh, Ramnagar, Kathgodam, and Tanakpur. Airports at Dehra Dun and Pantnagar offer domestic service.</p>
